# 💫 About Me:
Hi there! I'm Brendan, I'm a Front End Web Developer for the Portland Trail Blazers! I have a lot of experience with front end frameworks and backend development. I graduated Indiana University Indianapolis with a degree in Media Arts & Science. While I initially wanted to leverage my degree to pursue game development, I have since shifted into the world of web dev until I landed my current job! Feel free to look through my personal projects or ask me questions. I'm always eager to grow my network. When I'm not coding, you can find me working out, playing video games, or spending time with friends and loved ones.
